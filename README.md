# AlwaysTyping
### Plugin for [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord)

## Usage:
Press the button on your message bar ( ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaece034-5027-48f4-bef4-0b0244b3a12c) ) and it will show as if you are always typing until you turn it off

The indicator will be grey when it's off and green when it's on

#### Warning: This is probably very buggy

> (For some reason it wouldn't work if I didn't make it a required plugin so you can't enable or disable it, but it's not really necessary anyways; you can just delete the plugin if you don't want to use it.)

## Installation:
If you don't know how to install custom plugins on Vencord, read this https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/
